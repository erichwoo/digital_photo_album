# README for album.c

Because, the Project 1 assignment only allowed for .txt files, I named the Makefile as "Makefile.txt". Before compiling the Makefile, remember to rename "Makefile.txt" to "Makefile".

Additionally, if you would like verbose step-by-step print statements to track the flow and creation of every process, uncomment the VERBOSE flag at the header of the Makefile. if you would like to see the print statements of the display waiting, as well as the html-order-wait pipeline communication, uncomment the WAIT flag at the header of teh Makefile. Keep in mind, WAIT is a subset of VERBOSE.

The demo.c file that I attached should be exactly the same as the demo.c that Prof. Smith gave us. My album.c relies on demo.o as an object file.

To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.
